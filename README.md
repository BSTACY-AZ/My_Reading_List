# My_Reading_List
This is a React project utilizing Bootstrap to dynimically display data from within a JSON file. This project began as an assignment within Module 17 of the MITxPro course that I am taking in which we were asked to 'refactor" the tools written during the assignment. 

# Changes since the initial assignment
I've added additional data fields along with a subfolder containing the images of the covers of the books I intend to include. In addition, I opted to use a different card layout from Bootstrap and have added a NavBar 

# Future Roadmap (long term)
I have close to 200 book titles to include within this project and I plan to link to this information from my blog at some point in the future and maintain the information. However, long term I believe that the best solution would be to have the JSON created from a database store. 

# Future Roadmap (short term)
I hope to implement the following features/updates

* add tags to each title
* provide the ability to filter based on author, tag, or title from the NavBar
* provide the ability to search from the NavBar
* provide the ability to sort the list whether filtered or not
